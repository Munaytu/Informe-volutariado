        <p>I'm from Peru, and with a life in Spain, Bolivia was a map with no clear lines for me. But everything changed. I arrived and found a magical country: a culture you can breathe in every corner, deep roots that persist through time, and a geography that takes your breath awayâ€”not just for its grandeur, but because you are literally closer to the sky.</p>
        <p>I was looking for a different world, and Bolivia gave it to me in spades.</p>

              <p>The Illimani, that giant snowy peak, watches over the city like an ancient guardian. The Altiplano valleys stretch under a sky so blue it seems painted. It was a surprise for my eyes, yes, but also a constant reminder of the altitude: every step through those steep streets was a challenge for the lungs, an effort that left you breathless but made you feel intensely alive.</p>
              <p>"La Paz in motion," they say, and it's true. The traffic, that tide of cars and minibuses, initially filled me with frustration, but I soon learned to see it as part of the show, a pause to observe life from the window.</p>

                <p>The most significant week was helping organize a large forum in La Paz. Seeing so many organizations together and witnessing the team's expertise in managing such a large event was a powerful lesson in teamwork. There, I felt the true strength of the institution.</p>
